Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Goldilocks. She had golden hair. One day Goldilocks was walking in the forest. She saw a house and knocked on the door. She went inside. Nobody was there. Goldilocks saw three bowls on the table. She was hungry. ‘This porridge is too hot! This porridge is too cold! This porridge is just right!’ Goldilocks ate all the porridge.
