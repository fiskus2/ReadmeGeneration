Since then it has an active development community and is distributed under a BSD-style license. Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. SciPy makes use of Matplotlib. Michael Droettboom was nominated as matplotlib's lead developer shortly before John Hunter's death in August 2012 and was further joined by Thomas Caswell. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. Matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.
