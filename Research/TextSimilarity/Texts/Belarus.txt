Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich is in police detention in Minsk after the extraordinary diversion of his Ryanair flight from Greece, denounced by some as a "state hijacking". Mr Protasevich, 26, was until November 2020 editor of the opposition Nexta channel on the Telegram messaging app. The channel was founded by fellow dissident Stepan Putilo and run from outside Belarus. Nexta and Nexta Live, used for mobilising street protests, now have nearly two million subscribers, managing to get round heavy state censorship. Mr Protasevich faces serious charges. He and Mr Putilo - who calls himself Stepan Svetlov - were put on Belarus's list of "individuals involved in terrorist activity" last year. The charge of causing mass unrest can be punished by up to 15 years in jail. But terror offences carry higher sentences and as he was taken led off the plane passengers quoted him saying "I'll get the death penalty here".
